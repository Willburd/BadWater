# BadWater
 
An attempted reimplimentation of spacestation 13 in the Godot game enging using C#. Based on the polaris branch. Intended to host outpost 21, but should be able to function as a generic ss13 engine if ever completed. Redesigned gameplay in an attempt to streamline, make the game easier for new players to understand, and to cut out years of bloat and poor coding choices. As well as taking advantage of a modern game engine, and a far more scalable language.

God speed, we are all fools here.
