Sound effect resources go here, music has the Music folder. Each folder acts as a container that will randomly select any audio file present inside of it. For example the footsteps folder contains multiple folders with different material types, such as walking on rock or plating, inside of each of those folders are different audio files. These files are picked at random. While tedious for sounds without any randomization. It allows easy addition of randomized sounds, especially for area ambience tracks. As you only need to request the music folder's name when defining them.
