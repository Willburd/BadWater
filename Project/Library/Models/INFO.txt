Model resources go here, these are internally loaded scenes used for handling entities. These models may also be used as static props, for example most turfs use simple models, and share simple UVs so that multiple turfs may use the model to construct the map. Other more complex scenes are in these folders. Such as the sprite rendering mob scenes. These are used to decide the maximum canvas size of a mob from their json definition. Sprites and their animations are in the Sprites folder.
